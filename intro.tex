OMICS technologies are becoming increasingly popular for large-scale data
generation in biology and medicine. Mass spectrometry instrumentation, the core
technology in proteomics, provides improved sensitivity and throughput for
proteomics research. This increasing speed of data generation and the growing
data amount require automated methods for data processing.

MaxQuant is a widely used tool to analyze proteomics data. In its latest
release it is operated using an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) on
Windows and is not compatible with Linux, prohibiting easy access from the
command line or as a library.

mqrun starts and controls MaxQuant inside a virtual machine. The configuration
is specified in a json file that is easy for humans to edit and understand.
The supplied json-schema can be used to generate web interfaces and integrate
mqrun into existing workflow systems.
