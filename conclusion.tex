With the virtualization approach we are still unable to make use of features
we expect to from high performance computing tools: Scalability across
several nodes and maybe hundreds or thousands of cores and efficient
coordinated usage of I/O resources.  But we can take advantage of hardware
that is tied up in linux clusters and would not be otherwise usable. The
parameter format and the automation of MaxQaunt can be usefull for other
approaches as well.
